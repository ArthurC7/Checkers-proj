Currently, the project remains unfinished. This program is supposed to be a game of checkers specializing
in two different modes. At the main menu, the two options presented are "practice" and "multiplayer."
The practice is just supposed to be a one player mode where a single person moves the pieces around, according
 to programmed rules, and can have save states for practicing certain situations one may be in. 
 
Unfortunately, the program is in non-working condition for normal games of checkers. Due to the automation of 
the game being more complex than expected. The multiplayer does not work yet, with the various "RPS" files 
being used for "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in order to determine who gets to choose their color first. Hypothetically, after 
the rock,paper,scissors game, a split-screen configuration would appear on screen, with one screen facing the 
red pieces and the other the black pieces. This would have been the oppotunity to practice thread synchronization. 
Only the surrender option is available in multiplayer.
